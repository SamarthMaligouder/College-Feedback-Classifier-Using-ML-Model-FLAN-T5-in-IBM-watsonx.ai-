# College-Feedback-Classifier-Using-ML-Model-FLAN-T5-in-IBM-watsonx.ai-
This project demonstrates how GenAI can be used to automatically classify open- ended student feedback into meaningful categories like Academics, Facilities, and
Administration. By combining prompt-based logic with keyword simulation, we
created a scalable pipeline that helps educational institutions make data-driven
improvements. Even without directly integrating a live FLAN-T5 model, the use of few-shot prompt
engineering and intelligent keyword grouping allowed us to approximate multi-class
classification effectively. The results are saved in a structured CSV format, enabling
future analytics or dashboard integration. This kind of classifier can be extended or fine-tuned on real feedback and deployed
using APIs like IBM Watsonx or Hugging Faceâ€™s hosted models.
